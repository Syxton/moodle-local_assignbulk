# Assignment Bulk Upload #

Bulk upload file submissions to assignment

This plugin allows you to submit files for many users at once. You can upload a zip file of your students' submissions, and with a single click all of their submissions will be updated.

The format you upload is designed to be fairly flexible, so as long as you follow the golden rule, the structure of your files is probably fine already. The golden rule is this: the file name must be *exactly* the user identifier. The user can be identified by username, email address or ID number. In other words, if a user has username jsmith972, the file must be jsmith972.pdf or jsmith972.docx or even jsmith972.zip. But it can't be jsmith972_q1.eps or assignment1_jsmith972.ino.

Use the preview button to check if your file works. You can also use the file browser functionality - right click a file to unzip it, move files around, rename them.
